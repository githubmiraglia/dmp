<h1>ABOUT ARCADE</h1>
<h3>DANS MON PALAIS arcade games ("ARCADE") are based off but are not a straight copy of their originals. DANS MON PALAIS does not and will not charge any fee pertaining to the use of ARCADE. ARCADE is not an emulation platform, but rather games are programmed using HTML5 and Javascript. Like other vintage gaming platforms the intention of ARCADE is to preserve gaming history by preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten.<h3>
